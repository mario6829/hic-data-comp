This folder contains some macros that can be used to easily analyze
the data in a ROOT file.

- chipProfileTemp.C : reads the Root file with data from all modules and
                      plots some global histograms with the chip temperature

- chipSiteTemp.C : reads the Root file with data from all modules and
                   plots some histograms with the chip temperature, with
                   details for each production site

- reg700Plots.C : reads the Root file with data from all modules and
                  plots some histograms on the status of the 0x700 register
