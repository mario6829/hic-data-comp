 Pre-requisites
================

   In order to compile the software you need the XML2 library installed.
Even if it is not currently used, the `configure' script requires also the
Ncurses library to be present, since it finds references to it in the
header files. The packages are usually called `libxml2' and `ncurses',
consult your OS instructions about their actual name and on how to install
new system software on your system. 
   Please pay attention that many OSes split each software library into
different packages, e.g. one containing only the runtime libraries and
another one with the header files and the libraries used to link new programs
against the library. The development packages are the ones needed; usually
their name ends with "-devel" or "-dev" , again consult your OS instructions
and/or the list of available packages to determine the correct name.


 Installation
==============

   By default the `configure' script sets /usr/local as installation path:
this may require the user to be privileged in order to actually install the
software, using e.g.

sudo make install

   Alternatively a different installation location can be set, where the
user has write privileges, using the standard `configure' option --prefix
e.g.

./configure --prefix=/path/to/install

   Use

./configure --help

to print the list of all options, their use and their default values when
not set. The standard options are reported also in the INSTALL file (which
is the standard one coming with the `autoconf' package)


 User options
==============

   Besides standard options, as reported in the INSTALL file, `configure'
recognizes the following options to control the specific software:

`--with-libxml2-inc=DIR'
     Location of libxml2 header files (defaults to /usr/include/libxml2)

`--with-root=DIR'
     Location of Root installation (defaults to /opt/root)

`--with-alpide-sw=ALPDIR'
     Location of Alpide software tree

`--with-alpide-sw-inc=DIR'
     Location of Alipde software include (defaults to ALPDIR/inc)

`--with-alpide-db-inc=DIR'
     Location of Alipde DB software include (defaults to ALPDIR/DataBaseSrc)

`--with-alpide-pb-inc=DIR'
     Location of Alipde PowerBoard software include (defaults to ALPDIR/MosaicSrc/libpowerboard/include)

`--with-alpide-libmosaic-inc=DIR'
     Location of Alipde Mosaic software include (defaults to ALPDIR/MosaicSrc/libmosaic/include)

`--with-alpide-libs=DIR'
     Location of Alipde software libraries (defaults to ALPDIR/lib)
